## Penguins: an Easy, NPE-free Gateway to Unpacking and Illustrating NMR Spectra

<img src="docs/images/cookbook_subplots.png" height="450" >

```
pip install penguins
```

`penguins` is a Python 3 package intended mainly for generating publication-quality plots of NMR spectra in a programmatic, reproducible fashion.

Documentation can be found at https://penguins.readthedocs.io, although there is not much of it yet.

Note that `penguins` is still in development, so the interface should not be assumed to be stable!

[Regarding the name: I made this package after getting fed up of getting `java.lang.NullPointerException` in TopSpin's plot windows. It's especially bad on OS X Catalina. Also, penguins are cute. üêß]

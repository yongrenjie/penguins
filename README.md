Penguins: an Easy, NPE-free Gateway to Unpacking and Illustrating NMR Spectra

Fed up of `java.lang.NullPointerException`? I was, too, so I made this.

To install:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yongrenjie/penguins
    cd penguins
    pip install .     # or pip3 
```

Documentation (whatever I've written of it, at least) can be found at https://penguins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

How-tos
=======

There's necessarily going to be a lot of overlap with matplotlib.

Possible candidates here:

* How to customise 1D plots?

* How to customise 2D plots?

* How to compare two spectra? (this would use all the tools in the tutorial)

* How to read NUS data?

* How to create own layouts for plots (e.g. 5 spectra)?

* How to make a legend for a figure and not axes? (feat. ``cleanup_figure()``)

* How to reduce boilerplate code?

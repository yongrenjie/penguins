Welcome to penguins!
====================

|penguin| *Penguins: an Easy and NullPointerException-free Gateway to Unpacking and Illustrating NMR Spectra* |penguin|

**Penguins** is a Python 3 package intended mainly for generating publication-quality plots of NMR spectra in a programmatic, reproducible fashion.

The current version is |version|.

::

   pip install penguins

At the time of writing, it only supports Bruker data, and can only work with processed data. It is not intended to be an NMR processing suite, so does not have any functions for dealing with raw data (e.g. Fourier transformation).

To get started, head over to the :doc:`quickstart` page.

.. note::
   All code examples in the documentation, such as the following, can be run directly from the top-level penguins directory.

.. plot::

   import penguins as pg
   hsqc_dataset = pg.read("tests/data/pt2", 4, 1)
   hsqc_dataset.stage(f1_bounds="10..141",
                      f2_bounds="0.5..8.5",
                      colors=("seagreen", "hotpink"),
                      levels=2e4)
   pg.mkplot(title="An example HSQC")
   pg.show()

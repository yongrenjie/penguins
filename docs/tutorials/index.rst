Tutorials
=========

If you are new to penguins, then this is the place to start.
The following "basic" pages cover bite-sized pieces and can largely be read in sequence.

* `quickstart`  <-- This needs to be heavily simplified and split up into the next three.

* `Reading data <read_tutorial>`

* 1D plotting (TODO)

* 2D plotting (TODO)

The following "intermediate" topics cover some common use cases:

* Processing datasets (TODO) (projections, sums, magnitude mode, integration)

* Adding text (TODO)

* Having multiple spectra on a figure (TODO)

Tutorial 1: Reading data
========================

To get started with penguins, you will need some processed NMR data to play with (penguins currently **only** works with Bruker data).
If you don't have any, you can get some of the penguins test data: either click here to download a .zip archive, or clone the repository::

   git clone https://github.com/yongrenjie/penguins
   cd penguins/tests/nmrdata

If you cloned the repository you will find six datasets: we will only be using the first two.
The .zip archive should only contain two datasets.
